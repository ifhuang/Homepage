The dataset was originally collected in May 2011. We constructed our data set by crawling Twitter with Twitter APIs. First, we randomly selected 100,000 users as seeds to crawl users' following relationships. We crawled 284 million following relationships among 20 million users. From the 2 million users, we selected 3 million users, who have at least 10 relationships in our dataset, to crawl their user profiles. After crawling their profiles, we selected about 150 thousand users, who have their locations in their profiles, from the 3 million users to crawl their public tweets. For each user, we crawled at most 500 tweets.
